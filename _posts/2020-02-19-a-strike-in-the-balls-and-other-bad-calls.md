title: 'A Strike in the Balls, and other Bad Calls'

Here's a fun idea for a reoccuring series. And by fun I mean potentially toxic.

Each week, measure the following:

* called balls that are the closest to the center of the strike zone
* called strikes that are the furthest from the edges of a computed strike zone
* plays that are overturned by replay

Find the most extreemes:

* by furthest/closest by distance
* by leverage index of the AB
* by what looks really bad on the replay

Pull the clips from baseballsavant.mlb.com and stich them together with dates and names of the umps and post them on reddit.

Call it *A Strike in the Balls, and other Bad Calls of the Week*.
