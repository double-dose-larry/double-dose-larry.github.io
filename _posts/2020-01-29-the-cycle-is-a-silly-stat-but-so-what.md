title: The "cycle" is a silly stat ... but so what
---

In baseball, to hit for the cycle is to hit a single, double, triple and a home run, all in one game. 

The idea is that getting four hits is rare enough, but to get one of each type of hit is so much ... um ... cooler, I guess. The "coolness" of the cycle has made it an accomplishment that is tracked and really romanticized in baseball culture. It's often spoken in the same breath as "no-hitters" because they happen with about the same rarity. [If you hit for the cycle you're name is memorialzed in the baseball ball annals forever.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_players_to_hit_for_the_cycle). But is it really warrented?

People shit on the "cycle", saying that the coincidence of hitting for each type of hit doesn't measure anything. You better off hitting 3 for 6 with 3 homeruns. I mean, it's more total bases anyway.

Ok, dear reader, I can tell that you're thinking "I know where this is headed...", but NO... this article is not about shitting on the "cycle" or baseball lore or anything like that. 

In fact, fuck the nay-sayers, the cycle is cool as shit. What I want to talk about is the guys that should be credited for a cycle, but weren't because they got more bases on one of their hits.

For example:

Darryl Strawberry, August 16, 1987 in Wrigley Field.  Strawberry would have hit for the cycle if he had stopped at first on one of his doubles.   Also had a walk in the game, scored five runs and drove in five.  

Now let me ask you this, dear reader, do you think it's fair that Staw's name isn't enshrined on that list. The same list that has all time greats like Ted Williams, Rod Carew and *squints* [George Kottaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_players_to_hit_for_the_cycle). Think about it, if he consciously thought to himself, "hey, if I pull up on this double and settled for a single, I'm going to the record books", which, by the way, HE **literally** COULD HAVE, because he got a double on his last AB, he would have been right. No one would have said shit to him, especially because the Mets have put up 20 runs by that point.

Yet he didn't and took the extra base, and for that he is punished in history. His legacy is that much less potent because his name, now, doesn't appear on a list that, like it or not, will be passed down and looked at as long as baseball still exists.


I'm here to right this wrong, not only for Straw, but for all hitters in the history of the game that are not getting their due because they took the extra base.
