A [dying quail](http://baseballdictionary.com/dying-quail/) is a baseball term that means

>A pop fly that drops suddenly and unexpectedly, like a bird that has been shot on the wing. It often falls between fielders for a base hit.

This blog is kinda like that, something that never should amount to anything, like a popup, but will occasionally drop in for a hit.
